Before spending a few years in the macOS ecosystem, I was a long-time user of i3. For those unfamiliar, i3 and Sway perform the same function, but i3 is built for X.org while Sway is designed for Wayland. In this post, I’ll share my impressions, lessons learned, and the challenges I faced during this transition.\nThe Starting Point Currently, I’m using Ubuntu Linux version 24.04 (noble). Installing Sway was straightforward since it’s packaged for Ubuntu. A simple apt install sway, logging out of GNOME, and selecting Sway at the login screen were enough to get started. Having used i3 before, I wasn’t entirely lost.\nGlobal Keybindings (Media Keys, Power Button, etc.) As expected, some features didn’t work out-of-the-box as they do in GNOME. However, Sway’s configurability allowed me to tailor things to my liking. For instance:\nLocking the screen with a hotkey.\nPutting the laptop to standby when the power button is pressed.\nConfiguring volume and brightness keys.\nI dug up my seven-year-old i3 configuration for inspiration and adapted it to Sway. The resulting keybindings look like this:\nbindsym --locked XF86AudioMute exec pactl set-sink-mute @DEFAULT_SINK@ toggle bindsym --locked XF86AudioRaiseVolume exec pactl set-sink-volume @DEFAULT_SINK@ +5% bindsym --locked XF86AudioLowerVolume exec pactl set-sink-volume @DEFAULT_SINK@ -5% bindsym --locked XF86MonBrightnessUp exec sudo brightnessctl s \u0026#39;10%+\u0026#39; bindsym --locked XF86MonBrightnessDown exec sudo brightnessctl s \u0026#39;10%-\u0026#39; bindsym --locked XF86PowerOff exec systemctl suspend bindsym $mod+l exec swaylock -f -c 200020 --clock --indicator-idle-visible swayidle: Automatic Screen Locking To ensure the screen locks automatically after five minutes of inactivity, I installed swayidle, which is conveniently available on Ubuntu. However, I quickly missed having an indication of when the lock would occur. This was particularly annoying when I didn’t want the session to lock while still sitting at my desk. The solution? swaylock-effects. This tool offers additional features, such as --fade-in and --grace parameters, providing a visual cue and a grace period before locking.\nHere’s how it’s configured in my Sway setup:\nexec swayidle -w \\ timeout 300 \u0026#39;swaylock -f -c 200020 --clock --indicator-idle-visible --fade-in 3 --grace 3\u0026#39; \\ timeout 600 \u0026#39;swaymsg \u0026#34;output * power off\u0026#34;\u0026#39; resume \u0026#39;swaymsg \u0026#34;output * power on\u0026#34;\u0026#39; \\ before-sleep \u0026#39;swaylock -f -c 200020 --clock --indicator-idle-visible\u0026#39; Preventing Screen Lock During Video Playback By default, swayidle doesn’t detect when audio or video is playing. This meant my screen would lock during YouTube videos. The solution was SwayAudioIdleInhibit, a tool that’s not available in Ubuntu’s repositories. After cloning the repository and building it, I added the following line to my configuration:\nexec sway-audio-idle-inhibit Automatic Monitor Configuration Previously, I used autorandr with i3 for automatic monitor configuration. The Wayland equivalent is kanshi, which is also packaged for Ubuntu. After installation (apt install kanshi), I created a .config/kanshi/config file:\nprofile home { output \u0026#34;Samsung Electric Company U28E850 HTPK300903\u0026#34; mode 3840x2160 position 0,0 scale 2 output eDP-1 mode 1920x1080 position 1920,0 } profile laptop-only { output eDP-1 mode 1920x1080 position 0,0 } To find which outputs are there, what their respectives names are and/or which resolutions they support, run swaymsg -t get_outputs.\nMy external monitor runs at 4K with a scale of 2, while the laptop display doesn’t use scaling. To ensure everything starts automatically and to manage workspaces between monitors, I added these lines to my Sway config:\nbindsym $mod+w focus output HDMI-A-1 bindsym $mod+v focus output eDP-1 bindsym $mod+shift+w move workspace to output HDMI-A-1 bindsym $mod+shift+v move workspace to output eDP-1 exec kanshi Desktop Notifications Sway doesn’t include a built-in notification daemon. I chose mako, which also required building from source. Adding the following line to my configuration ensures it runs on startup:\nexec mako Screenshare Turns out you need to have a look into screen sharing as well. Was a not so nice experience when I wanted to share my screen in a meeting and noticed, that Chromium no longer is able to do that.\nTo fix this\nmake sure to install xdg-desktop-portal-wlr and\nadd the following to sway config exec dbus-update-activation-environment --systemd WAYLAND_DISPLAY XDG_CURRENT_DESKTOP=sway\n","permalink":"https://stesie.github.io/2025/01/switching-to-sway/","summary":"A few days ago, I switched to the Sway window manager after returning to GNU/Linux a few months ago.

During my exploration, I discovered Roland Kaufmann’s blog post on the Programmer Dvorak Keyboard Layout, which resonated deeply with me. Kaufmann thoughtfully considered the symbols developers frequently use and how they align with the Dvorak philosophy of optimizing for typing efficiency.\nBack then, I was using the standard US layout, employing creative methods to access German umlauts—either through AltGr combinations (e.g., AltGr + A for \u0026ldquo;ä\u0026rdquo;) or dead keys (\u0026ldquo;ae\u0026rdquo; for \u0026ldquo;ä\u0026rdquo;). However, Kaufmann\u0026rsquo;s insights inspired me to retrain my brain and fingers for Dvorak.\nInitially, the transition was frustrating. On QWERTY, I was a decently fast typist, but switching to Dvorak felt like starting from scratch. Over time, my fingers adapted, and Dvorak became my everyday keyboard layout for several years.\nIn essence, this is what the layout looked like (numbers in natural order, yet still with Shift modifier): A Pause in the Journey This phase ended abruptly about six years ago when I joined a client project that required me to use a locked-down Windows laptop. While I could configure the keyboard layout, Programmer Dvorak wasn’t an option—custom layouts were off the table. Reluctantly, I returned to the standard German (DE) layout. The switch felt like letting go of a quirky yet cherished habit, but practicality won.\nA Christmas Experiment Fast forward to this Christmas break. I found myself wondering: after all these years, could my muscle memory still recall Programmer Dvorak? To my surprise, the answer was a resounding yes!\nAs I sat down to test it, my fingers remembered the layout far better than my conscious mind did. When I overthought it—trying to mentally locate keys—I was prone to mistakes. But when I let my fingers take over, they instinctively found their way to the right keys.\nCustomizing My Setup Alongside this experiment, I started using Sway, a Wayland compositor, and wanted to configure it to support my old layout. After some research, I created an XKB configuration file to define my customized Programmer Dvorak with German umlauts. Here\u0026rsquo;s what I did:\nStep 1: Create the XKB Config File I placed the following in ~/.xkb/symbols/us-dvp-german-umlaut:\ndefault partial alphanumeric_keys xkb_symbols \u0026#34;basic\u0026#34; { include \u0026#34;us(dvp)\u0026#34; include \u0026#34;level3(ralt_switch)\u0026#34; name[Group1] = \u0026#34;English (US, Dvorak with German umlaut)\u0026#34;; key \u0026lt;AE01\u0026gt; { [ ampersand, 1, ampersand, 1 ] }; key \u0026lt;AE02\u0026gt; { [ bracketleft, 2, bracketleft, 2, currency ] }; key \u0026lt;AE03\u0026gt; { [ braceleft, 3, braceleft, 3, cent ] }; key \u0026lt;AE04\u0026gt; { [ braceright, 4, braceright, 4, yen ] }; key \u0026lt;AE05\u0026gt; { [ parenleft, 5, parenleft, 5, EuroSign ] }; key \u0026lt;AE06\u0026gt; { [ equal, 6, equal, 6, sterling ] }; key \u0026lt;AE07\u0026gt; { [ asterisk, 7, asterisk, 7 ] }; key \u0026lt;AE08\u0026gt; { [ parenright, 8, parenright, 8, onehalf ] }; key \u0026lt;AE09\u0026gt; { [ plus, 9, plus, 9 ] }; key \u0026lt;AE10\u0026gt; { [ bracketright, 0, bracketright, 0 ] }; key \u0026lt;AE11\u0026gt; { [ exclam, percent, exclam, percent, exclamdown ] }; key \u0026lt;AE12\u0026gt; { [ numbersign, grave, numbersign, grave ] }; key \u0026lt;AC01\u0026gt; { [ a, A, adiaeresis, Adiaeresis ] }; key \u0026lt;AC02\u0026gt; { [ o, O, odiaeresis, Odiaeresis ] }; key \u0026lt;AC03\u0026gt; { [ e, E, EuroSign, cent ] }; key \u0026lt;AC04\u0026gt; { [ u, U, udiaeresis, Udiaeresis ] }; }; Step 2: Update the Sway Config In the Sway configuration file, I activated the custom layout for all keyboards:\ninput \u0026#34;type:keyboard\u0026#34; { xkb_layout us-dvp-german-umlaut } This setup builds upon the default Programmer Dvorak (us(dvp)) layout, reconfigures the top row for natural numeric order, and maps German umlauts to AltGr combinations.\nThe Aftermath While reconnecting with Programmer Dvorak definitely was a nice experiment, \u0026hellip; I switched back to regular German keyboard layout after the Christmas break. While regular typing went decently well, I struggled and didn\u0026rsquo;t feel well with the keyboard shortcuts (for example in IntelliJ), many of them get awkward easily.\n","permalink":"https://stesie.github.io/2024/12/rediscovering-programmer-dvorak/","summary":"About 15 years ago, I stumbled upon the Dvorak keyboard layout, an alternative to the ubiquitous QWERTY layout designed for ergonomic and efficient typing.

How hard can it be?\nZunächst soll nicht unerwähnt bleiben, dass Dienste wie Strava erlauben, eine zufällige Route zu erzeugen; meinen Geschmack treffen die Ergebnisse jedoch eher selten. Wenn man “nur Straße” auswählt, wird man häufig über Staats- und teilweise auch Bundesstraßen geführt, was ich (insbesondere alleine) ätzend finde.\nKartenmaterial Ganz grundsätzlich brauchen wir zunächst einmal Kartenmaterial, weil eine Route ohne Straßen und Karte nicht funktioniert. Zum Glück gibt es das großartige Projekt OpenStreetMap, bei dem viele Freiwillige Kartendaten zusammen tragen. Meist in sehr hoher Qualität, und das auch was Nebenstraßen angeht. Und gerade dort macht es mit dem Rad auch einen großen Unterschied, wie es um Belag und Oberflächenbeschaffenheit bestellt ist.\nOpenStreetMap ist erstmal eine große Datenbank, in der alle möglichen Informationen “gemapped” sind. Das geht beim Offensichtlichen los: Straßen und Häuser. Umfasst aber auch Gleise, Läden \u0026amp; Cafes, Stromtrassen, Bushaltestellen, Glascontainer, Mülleimer, Bänke … kurzum alles, was irgendwie mit Geodaten zu tun hat und zu dem sich bisher Freiwillige fanden, es einzupflegen. An diesen Elementen hängen dann mit Schlüssel-Wert-Paaren weitere Informationen, wie beispielsweise Straßenbelag, Wegbeschaffenheit, Gehsteig vorhanden, Beleuchtet, etc.\nUns interessieren davon erstmal nur Wege. Und da nur die Typen highway (Straße), track (sonstige Wege) und path (Pfade). Die Straßen sind dabei weiter detailliert, sodass man Bundesstraßen (primary), Staatsstraßen (secondary), Kreisstraßen (tertiary), Ortsverbindungsstraßen (unclassified), etc. auseinanderhalten kann.\nEin (naiver) erster Ansatz Wir haben einen Startpunkt und eine grobe Idee von der Streckenlänge. Anschließend …\nberechnen wir den Radius eines Kreises, der im Umfang der gewünschten Streckenlänge entspricht\nwählen wir einen zufälligen Kreis dieses Radiuses, der unseren Startpunkt schneidet (damit bestimmen wir die Himmelsrichtung in die die Runde geht)\nwählen wir fünf zufällige Checkpoints, die auf diesem Kreis liegen (wobei einer der Startpunkt ist)\nsuchen wir für jeden Checkpoint einen Punkt, den wir potentiell anfahren wollen/können (anders ausgedrückt: suche den nächst gelegenen Punkt, der auf einer Kreis- oder Ortsverbindungsstraße liegt – schließlich wollen wir nicht viermal auf den Acker laufen)\nsuchen wir eine Route von Checkpoint zu Checkpoint\n… damit haben wir eine Route. Um diese dann auf Mastodon zu bringen, brauchen wir einerseits einen API-Client, andererseits noch eine Möglichkeit, die Route auf einer Karte darzustellen. Weil ohne Bild wäre der Tröt (“Tweet” in Mastodon-Lingo) wenig attraktiv.\nBestandsaufnahme Nachdem wir das nicht alles selbst bauen wollen, brauchen wir im Wesentlichen also\neinen “fernsteuerbaren” Router\neine Möglichkeit, wie wir die nächstgelegene geeignete Straße zu einem gegebenen Punkt finden können.\nBesagter Router muss nicht nur skriptbar sein und auf OpenStreetMap fußen, sondern soll flexibel/clever genug sein was die Streckenauswahl betrifft und – optional – auch das Höhenprofil berücksichtigen.\nHier kommt BRouter ins Spiel. Das ist eine Java-Anwendung (ursprünglich für Android), die man mit einem Routing-Profil füttern kann, und dann via HTTP die “beste” Strecke zwischen zwei (oder mehr) Punkten abfragen kann. Besagter BRouter bringt auch gleich ein Profil mit dem tollen Namen fastbike-verylowtraffic mit, das genau das tut was es verspricht: nur befestigte Wege, wenn möglich Kreis- oder Ortsverbindungsstraßen und Radwege. Standardmäßig ohne Berücksichtigung der Höhenmeter, das kann man auf Wunsch jedoch aktivieren.\nBei der initialen Suche nach geeigneten Checkpoints bietet sich die Overpass API an. Dieser kann man beliebige Anfragen in einer speziellen Abfragesprache (Overpass Query Language) stellen. Im einfachsten Fall die Suche nach z. B. einem Geldautomaten in einem bestimmten Bereich (typischerweise rechteckig). Es gibt jedoch auch einen around-Filter, mit dem man Objekte relativ zu anderen Elementen suchen kann.\nDie Abfrage selbst wirkt zunächst arkan:\n[out:json]; (way [highway~\u0026#39;tertiary|unclassified\u0026#39;] (around:1000.0,49.84178672462459,10.06466533810437); \u0026gt;; ); out; Sehen wir uns die Abfrage genauer an:\nwir fordern eine Antwort in JSON (statt XML)\nsuchen einen/alle Weg/e\nmit Attribut highway=tertiary oder highway=unclassified\nim Umkreis von 1000 Metern um einen gegebenen Punkt\nvon den so selektierten Wegen sollen sodann die Punkte (aka parents) abgefragt werden (\u0026gt;;)\nund das Ergebnis wollen wir auch haben (out;)\nUmsetzung Meine Lieblingsprogrammiersprache ist TypeScript. Eine kurze Recherche hat gezeigt, dass es gut gepflegte NPM-Module zum Ansprechen von Overpass (overpass-ts) und für erdräumliche Berechnungen (@turf/turf) gibt.\nAlle Funktionen von turf basieren auf GeoJSON, einem offenem Format, um eben geografische Daten in Form sog. Features zu repräsentieren. Solche Features können dann Punkte, Linien oder Polygone sein.\nUm den Ablauf des Skriptes transparenter zu bekommen, bietet es sich an, sämtliche Zwischenschritte als GeoJSON-FeatureCollection abzuspeichern. Unter geojson.io findet sich ein Online-Viewer, in den man jenes GeoJSON dann kopieren (und sodann betrachten) kann.\nAn diesem lässt sich dann gut erkennen, wie die Anwendung Schritt für Schritt vorgeht:\nWas passiert hier eigentlich? Sehen wir uns nun einmal im Detail an, was auf diesem Bild alles zu sehen ist:\nder Startpunkt (= grauer Marker) direkt in Würzburg\nKreis um diesen ziehen und einen Punkt davon als Routenmittelpunkt bestimmen (= grüner Marker)\nKreis um den grünen Marker bestimmen und fünf Checkpunkte auf diesem festlegen (= graues Polygon)\nfür alle Ecken (mit Overpass) die nächstgelegene (geeignete) Straße finden (= gelbliche Marker/Polygon)\nmit BRouter Routen zwischen ebendiesen Punkten erstellen (= rote Linien)\n“dead ends” entfernen, also Wege, die zu gelben Markern führen und dann direkt wieder zurück (= rote Marker)\nDie Koordinaten von Startpunkt und (korrigierten) Checkpoint-Markern können wir dann ein letztes mal dem BRouter füttern, der daraus eine GPX-Datei zaubert. GPX (= GPS Exchange Format) ist ein offenes XML-Format, mit dem Routen beschrieben werden können und das von den üblichen GPS-Geräten verstanden wird.\nDer o.g. Viewer für GeoJSON kann übrigens, trotz des Namens, auch GPX laden.\nGrafik rendern Ein Tröt ohne Bild ist langweilig. Aber wie bekommen wir einen Screenshot einer Karte mit unserer Route darauf?\nVielleicht nicht die effizienteste Lösung, aber zumindest straight forward: wir nehmen einfach einen Browser plus die Standard-JavaScript-Library zum Kartenrendering: Leaflet nebst GPX-Track-Plugin.\nNun brauchen wir nur noch etwas, das uns den Screenshot auf Kommando anfertigt: Googles Rendertron. Rendertron kann man auch wieder einfach per HTTP aufrufen, die URL übergeben (+ gewünschte Größe) und bekommt den Screenshot im JPG-Format zurück.\nAutomatisch Tröten Jetzt brauchen wir noch einen (Bot-)Account auf der Mastodon-Instanz unserer Wahl. In meinem Fall ist das wue.social. Und ein CLI-Tool, mit dem wir Route nebst Bild tröten können: toot.\nDas Ergebnis all der Arbeit? Ein Tröt:\nDamit kann unser Mashup auf die Zielgerade: noch ein bisschen Docker und ein paar Cronjobs – fertig ist der Bot :-)\n… und der ganze Rest Natürlich kann ich euch viel erzählen – ihr könnt euch aber auch selbst vom Bot überzeugen:\nProfilseite des Bots: @rbrb\nQuellcode des Projekts\n","permalink":"https://stesie.github.io/2022/05/rb-road-bike-route-bot-auf-mastodon/","summary":"Ein Erfahrungsbericht, weil ich …\nmal wieder was mit Geodaten machen wollte (und mich OpenStreetMap schon eine ganze Weile immer wieder umtreibt)\nschon länger darüber nachdenke, wie gut es wohl funktioniert, einen zufälligen Fahrrad-Routenvorschlag nach eigenem Gusto zu erzeugen\nschon länger im Fediverse (Mastodon) bin und während des Alle-Verlassen-Twitter-Hypes einen Bot zu bauen nahe liegt\nAlso los geht’s.

After all both events attracted (slightly) different kinds of people. And as barcamps are largely shaped by their participators it\u0026rsquo;s due to this fact that both events felt different\u0026hellip;\ndevelopercamp was organized by Mayflower which is a project \u0026amp; consulting agency in PHP \u0026amp; JavaScript field, also doing some Agile consulting, etc. \u0026hellip; they mainly attracted (and this is personal gut feeling, not statistics) Webbish people, mostly developers but also a lot of product owners. Most attendees had an e-commerce background, be it a webshop, some shop software itself (Benjamin from Shopware was there) or some middleware provider. Topics were manifold, from What\u0026rsquo;s the job of a software architect? (which was interesting with half the audience from an Agile background and the other half from a more waterfallish one) over various Product Owner and discovery focussed stuff to dev-centric like Christopher\u0026rsquo;s TypeScript Game Engine Primer. Yet most sessions felt like fitting into my personal PHP/JavaScript/CleanCode filter bubble.\nOpposed to that swecamp was organized by methodpark which also does projects and consulting, yet in more enterprisy contexts: medical devices and automotive. They managed to attract people from a (perceived) broader range of backgrounds \u0026hellip; of course there were many of their own employees (Java, Embedded), more Java and C#, C++ and embedded devs from companies nearby \u0026hellip; and of course also some Webbies (like me). The session topics were a bit more focussed on the engineering part and theoretical (read: language agnostic and less hands-on-code oriented) and a bit more testing. There were no Product Owner things and interestingly no operations stuff (Puppet, Ansible et al) and IoT was more of a topic (unfortunately I completely missed the IoT hack space)\nWhat was especially cool with swecamp was that they had Susume Sasabe from Japan as a special guest, who did a comparison of DEV culture in Japan and Germany. He also spoke about Kaizen, different approaches to knowledge transfer, different problem solving methods etc. \u0026hellip; all in all enriching the whole event every here and there. Besides that I really enjoyed @NullPlusEins\u0026rsquo;s sessions on (developer) psychology.\nI also happily noticed that CQRS and Event Sourcing were a topic on both events, maybe a little bit more focussed on DDD at swecamp. This isn\u0026rsquo;t too surprising because of all the microservices buzz (which also was a hot topic on both events). Again serverless was not a topic, meh.\nLast but not least swecamp was hosted in methodpark\u0026rsquo;s office which was way cosier and more comfortable, more decorated than the university building in Würzburg (where developercamp took place).\nTo sum it up, both events have their unique points. I really enjoyed developercamp (as a Web developer) and also swecamp, both had some sessions that really resonated with me (and after all that\u0026rsquo;s the main reason for me to go to unconferences: learning about things I don\u0026rsquo;t know that I don\u0026rsquo;t know them). I\u0026rsquo;m so happy that I don\u0026rsquo;t have to pick a single event to go to next year. Both organizers already told that they\u0026rsquo;ll follow up with a second iteration (and I\u0026rsquo;m more then willing to go to both of them)\nPS: as a funny note, the devops camp site is the only one hosted with plain, unencrypted HTTP. Both more developer focussed events feature SSL :-)\nPPS: developercamp also hosts on IPv6 and their hosting also supports Forward Secrecy, so let\u0026rsquo;s consider it better.

Since the whole kata is about data transformation the functional aspects really pay off here. What I really found interesting regarding their implementation of story 3 was that they kept their transformation function for lowercase words unmodified (like I would have expected) but before that detected the word\u0026rsquo;s case and build a pair consisting of the lower case word plus a transformation function to restore the casing afterwards. When I did the kata on my own I kept the case in a variable and then used some conditionals (which I think is a bit less elegant) \u0026hellip;\nBesides that feedback was positive and we had a lot of fun doing the kata.\n\u0026hellip; and as a facilitator I underestimated how long it takes the pairs/teams to form, choose a test framework and get started.

Yet there is one thing I didn\u0026rsquo;t know how to do: Pub/Sub or \u0026ldquo;Realtime Messaging\u0026rdquo;.\nRealtime messaging allows to build web applications that can instantly receive messages published by another application (or the same one running in a different person\u0026rsquo;s browser). There even are cloud services permitting to do exactly this, e.g. Realtime Messaging Platform and PubNub Data Streams \u0026hellip;\nHowever recently having played with AWS Lambda and S3 I was wondering how this could be achieved on AWS\u0026hellip; and at first it seemed like it really isn\u0026rsquo;t possible. Especially the otherwise very interesting article Receiving AWS IoT messages in your browser using websockets by @jtparreira misled me, as he\u0026rsquo;s telling that it wouldn\u0026rsquo;t be possible. The article was published Nov 2015, \u0026hellip; not so long ago. But turns out it\u0026rsquo;s outdated anyways\u0026hellip;\nEnter AWS IoT While reading I stumbled over AWS IoT which allows to connect \u0026ldquo;Internet of Things\u0026rdquo; devices to the AWS cloud and furthermore provides messaging between those devices. It has a message broker (aka Device Gateway) sitting in the middle and \u0026ldquo;things\u0026rdquo; around it that connect to it. It\u0026rsquo;s based on the MQTT protocol and there are SDKs for the Raspberry Pi (Node.js), Android \u0026amp; iOS \u0026hellip; sound\u0026rsquo;s interesting, but not at all like \u0026ldquo;web browsers\u0026rdquo;\nMQTT over Web Sockets Then I found an announcement: AWS IoT Now Supports WebSockets published Jan 28, 2016. Brand new, but sounds great :)\n\u0026hellip; so even when IoT still sounds strange to do Pub/Sub with - it looks like a way to go.\nMaking it work For the proof of concept I didn\u0026rsquo;t care to publish AWS IAM User keys to the web application (of course this is a smell to be fixed before production use). So I went to \u0026ldquo;IAM\u0026rdquo; in the AWS management console and created a new user first, attaching the pre-defined AWSIoTDataAccess policy.\nSo the proof of concept should involve a simple web page that allows to establish a connection to the broker, features a text box where a message can be typed plus a publish button. So if two browsers are connected simultaneously then both should immediately receive messages published by one of them.\nrequired parts: \u0026hellip; we of course need a MQTT client and we need to do AWS-style request signing in the browser. NPM modules to the rescue:\naws-signature-v4 does the signature calculation\ncrypto helps it + some extra hashing we need to do\nmqtt has an MqttClient\n\u0026hellip; all of them have browser support through webpack. So we just need some more JavaScript to string everything together. To set up the connection:\nlet client = new MqttClient(() =\u0026gt; { const url = v4.createPresignedURL( \u0026#39;GET\u0026#39;, AWS_IOT_ENDPOINT_HOST.toLowerCase(), \u0026#39;/mqtt\u0026#39;, \u0026#39;iotdevicegateway\u0026#39;, crypto.createHash(\u0026#39;sha256\u0026#39;).update(\u0026#39;\u0026#39;, \u0026#39;utf8\u0026#39;).digest(\u0026#39;hex\u0026#39;), { \u0026#39;key\u0026#39;: AWS_ACCESS_KEY, \u0026#39;secret\u0026#39;: AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY, \u0026#39;protocol\u0026#39;: \u0026#39;wss\u0026#39;, \u0026#39;expires\u0026#39;: 15 } ); return websocket(url, [ \u0026#39;mqttv3.1\u0026#39; ]); }); \u0026hellip; here createPresignedURL from aws-signature-v4 first does the heavy-lifting for us. We tell it the IoT endpoint address, protocol plus AWS credentials and it provides us with the signed URL to connect to.\nThere was just one stumbling block to me: I had upper-case letters in the hostname (as it is output by aws iot describe-endpoint command), the module however doesn\u0026rsquo;t convert these to lower case as expected by AWS\u0026rsquo; V4 signing process \u0026hellip; and as a matter of that access was denied first.\nHaving the signed URL we simply pass it on to a websocket-stream and create a new MqttClient instance around it.\nConnection established \u0026hellip; time to subscibe to a topic. Turns out to be simple:\nclient.on(\u0026#39;connect\u0026#39;, () =\u0026gt; client.subscribe(MQTT_TOPIC)); Handling incoming messages \u0026hellip; also easy:\nclient.on(\u0026#39;message\u0026#39;, (topic, message) =\u0026gt; console.log(message.toString())); \u0026hellip; and last not least publishing messages \u0026hellip; trivial again:\nclient.publish(MQTT_TOPIC, message); \u0026hellip; that\u0026rsquo;s it :-)\nMy proof of concept here\u0026rsquo;s what it looks like:\n\u0026hellip; the last incoming message was published from another browser running the exact same application.\nI\u0026rsquo;ve published my source code as a Gist on Github, feel free to re-use it.\nTo try it yourself:\nclone the Gist\nadjust the constants declared at the top of main.js as needed\ncreate a user in IAM first, see above\nfor the endpoint host run aws iot describe-endpoint CLI command\nrun npm install\nrun ./node_modules/.bin/webpack-dev-server --colors\nNext steps This was just the first (big) part. There\u0026rsquo;s more stuff left to be done:\nneither is hard-coding AWS credentials into the application source the way to go nor is publishing the secret key at all\n\u0026hellip; one possible approach would be to use the API Gateway + Lambda to create pre-signed URLs\n\u0026hellip; this could be further limited by using IAM roles and temporary identity federation (through STS Token Service)\nthere\u0026rsquo;s no user authentication yet, this should be achievable with AWS Cognito\n\u0026hellip; with that publishing/subscribing could be limitted to identity-related topics (depends on the use case)\n","permalink":"https://stesie.github.io/2016/04/aws-iot-pubsub/","summary":"I\u0026rsquo;m currently very interested in serverless (aka no dedicated backend required) JavaScript Web Applications \u0026hellip; with AWS S3, Lambda \u0026amp; API Gateway you can actually get pretty far.

The generator into generator injection is handled by yet another generator \u0026hellip; turn\u0026rsquo;s out: it works, but doesn\u0026rsquo;t look so nice. The outer generator cannot simply inject generators endlessly (since they are actually instanciated), so injection has to be deferred - that however dilutes the self-contained sieve generator :-(\nAnyways it was a good exercise on PHP\u0026rsquo;s generators. I think I\u0026rsquo;ll give it another try soon, again with generators yet another approach.\n","permalink":"https://stesie.github.io/2016/03/happy-and-lucky-numbers/","summary":"The other day I paired with the guys from @solutiondrive and @niklas_heer, we had a fun evening learing about happy numbers, shared PhpStorm knowledge, tried Codeception etc. Actually we didn\u0026rsquo;t even finish the \u0026ldquo;Happy Numbers\u0026rdquo; Kata, since we only wrote the classifying routine, not the loop generating the output.\nOn my way home I kept googling and also found out about Lucky Numbers.

Way too much for server side rendering (on more or less every request).\nUp to V8 4.4 you simply could compile it with snapshots and V8Js made use of them. With 4.4 that stopped (V8Js just kept crashing), and I never really cared what they could do nor what the performance hit of this is, I just disabled them.\n\u0026hellip; turns out there even are three modes:\nno snapshots at all (what I did then)\nsnapshots support enabled, with external snapshot data (the default)\nsnapshots support enabled, with internal snapshot data (the snapshots are then linked into the library itself)\nThose snapshots are created once at compile time and store the state of V8\u0026rsquo;s heap after it has fully initialized itself. Hence their benefit is that the engine doesn\u0026rsquo;t fully bootstrap over and over, \u0026hellip; it simply restores the snapshot and is (almost) ready to start.\nOnly the second of those three modes wasn\u0026rsquo;t supported by V8Js, since it simply didn\u0026rsquo;t provide the external startup data \u0026ndash; and hence V8 failed to start.\nDigging deeper into snapshots I found out about custom startup snapshots. V8 since version 4.3 allows extra JavaScript code to be embedded into the snapshot itself. This is you can bake React \u0026amp; ReactServer right into the snapshot so it doesn\u0026rsquo;t have to re-evaluate the source over and over again.\nThe performance impact of this is enormous:\nThe Y-axis shows milliseconds, the blue bar the amount of time needed by V8 to bootstrap, the red bar time needed to evaluate React \u0026amp; ReactServer source code. Timings are averages over 100 samples taken on my Core i5 laptop.\nI compiled V8 5.0.104 with snapshot support, hence the blue bar immediately drops from about 60 ms down to about 4 ms. Since the base snapshots doesn\u0026rsquo;t have React included, the red bare remains at ~90 ms at first.\n\u0026hellip; including React into the snapshot, the red bar of course is gone, bootstrapping takes a little longer then \u0026ndash; but it is many times faster than without snapshots.\n","permalink":"https://stesie.github.io/2016/02/snapshot-performance/","summary":"Recently @virgofx filed an issue on V8Js whether (startup) performance of V8Js could be increased.

Good time to loose some words on the project and why I like it, so here we go :-)\nV8Js is a PHP extension that integrates Google\u0026rsquo;s V8 JavaScript engine into PHP. This is the extension allows you to execute JavaScript code securely sandboxed from PHP. Besides it allows for simple exchange of data from PHP to JavaScript and back.\nI like V8Js as it allows to run customer-provided code on the server, knowing that it is properly sandboxed so it cannot interact with all your PHP classes, variables and whatnot. Instead you can (and have to) provide a restricted set of classes acting as an API the JavaScript code can use.\nFirst things first, a simple hello world:\n$a = new V8Js(); $a-\u0026gt;executeString(\u0026#39;print(\u0026#34;Hello World\\n\u0026#34;);\u0026#39;); \u0026hellip; super simple and doesn\u0026rsquo;t do very much.\nOf course you can inject object instances as well:\nclass LoaderWriter { public function addRecord($type = \u0026#39;text\u0026#39;, $value = \u0026#39;\u0026#39;) { echo \u0026#34;addRecord -- $type, $value\\n\u0026#34;; } } $jscode = \u0026lt;\u0026lt;\u0026lt; EOT PHP.loader.addRecord(\u0026#34;text\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;first loader insert\u0026#34;); EOT; $a = new V8Js(); $a-\u0026gt;loader = new LoaderWriter(); $a-\u0026gt;executeString($jscode); However that\u0026rsquo;s still stuff you\u0026rsquo;d expect to work. What about pushing closures from JavaScript to PHP and call these from PHP? Works!\nclass Parser { protected $_callbacks = array(); public function on($element, $callback) { $this-\u0026gt;_callbacks[$element] = $callback; } public function runParser() { // should be fleshed out of course :-) $this-\u0026gt;_callbacks[\u0026#39;node\u0026#39;](\u0026#39;node-1 content\u0026#39;); $this-\u0026gt;_callbacks[\u0026#39;node\u0026#39;](\u0026#39;node-2 content\u0026#39;); } } $jscode = \u0026lt;\u0026lt;\u0026lt; EOT PHP.parser.on(\u0026#34;node\u0026#34;, function(data) { print(\u0026#34;Found node, content \u0026#34; + data + \u0026#34;\\n\u0026#34;); }); EOT; $a = new V8Js(); $a-\u0026gt;parser = new Parser(); $a-\u0026gt;executeString($jscode); $a-\u0026gt;parser-\u0026gt;runParser(); \u0026hellip; this way you can easily use PHP\u0026rsquo;s nice XmlReader to read chunks from XML files and have a customer-provided piece of JavaScript code bind on certain elements to drive customer-fitted data imports.\nThe code just does what you expect, it initializes a parser class, binds an element handle (which is a JavaScript function) and afterwards the parser (written in PHP) just calls the callback function transparently. And of course it\u0026rsquo;s not just possible to provide scalar values back and forth, you can pass objects just as transparently.\nTurned out that V8Js leaked some memory for each object being passed back to JavaScript, which doesn\u0026rsquo;t hurt much if you do it for a limited number of times. If you run the callback from above for a huge XML file you\u0026rsquo;re quickly hit. The problem was, that V8Js incremented the refcount on the PHP object, but didn\u0026rsquo;t decrease if V8 decided to dispose the JavaScript instance. The fix for this is merged since July 11th.\nOfficially the PECL package is still in beta state and I found some bugs after a limited number of evaluation hours \u0026hellip; if you can live with that I think V8Js is a pretty cool sandbox environment, definitely worth a look.\nSince I\u0026rsquo;ve made myself familiar with the source I also replaced deprecated calls to V8 API by newer equivalents and allowed for construction of PHP objects from JavaScript. This is do stuff like that:\n$v8 = new V8Js(); class Greeter { function sayHello($a) { echo \u0026#34;Hello $a\\n\u0026#34;; } } $jscode = \u0026lt;\u0026lt;\u0026lt; EOT PHP.greeter.sayHello(\u0026#34;John\u0026#34;); // prints \u0026#34;Hello John\u0026#34; as expected print(PHP.greeter); print(\u0026#34;\\n\u0026#34;); // prints \u0026#34;[object Greeter]\u0026#34; as expected // What about the constructor function of greeter? print(PHP.greeter.constructor); // ... yields \u0026#34;function Greeter() { [native code] }\u0026#34; // ... super, so let me create more greeters :-) var ngGreeter = new PHP.greeter.constructor(); ngGreeter.sayHello(\u0026#34;Ringo\u0026#34;); // well, ... used to segfault :-) EOT; $v8-\u0026gt;greeter = new Greeter(); $v8-\u0026gt;executeString($jscode); \u0026hellip; I can\u0026rsquo;t immediately come up with a use case, but hey, JavaScript is all about (constructor) functions, so it definitely should work.
