After @sD_Tobi recently poked me whether I knew phpspec, … and initially I had no idea except for having heard of it … I found [this excellent screencast on laracasts.com](https://laracasts.com/lessons/phpspec-is-so-good) to get a first impression.  It's just 17 minutes and he's really enthusiastic about it :-)
