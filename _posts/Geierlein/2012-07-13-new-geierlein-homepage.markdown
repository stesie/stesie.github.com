My recent project _Geierlein_ just got a new,
[standalone homepage](http://stesie.github.com/geierlein/).  For
the last weeks there solely was a single page in the Taxbird blog dedicated
to it.  Since I consider Geierlein the successor of Taxbird, I felt it
was way too hidden there.

The new page pulls it more into the light.  I've kept it very short, just
stating the key features, showing a single screenshot and always visible
download links.

Since I wanted to host the page on Github, I gave
[Jekyll](https://github.com/mojombo/jekyll/) a try.  Jekyll is a simple
static site generator written in Ruby.  It allows to write the page
content in markdown syntax (among others).  This content is then rendered
to HTML and put into provided templates.

Github automatically does the rendering once the markdown code is pushed
into the repository.
