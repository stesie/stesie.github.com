Today I've released version 0.8.0 of Geierlein, the free Elster client
written in HTML5 & JavaScript.  Release aspects are, among others

* bumping the Firefox MaxVersion to 41, to allow using it on the Firefox 41
  XUL engine
* upgrade of the included JavaScript crypto library
  [Forge](https://github.com/digitalbazaar/forge)
* switching over to RSAES-OAEP encryption scheme (from good old PKCS#7 scheme)

The encryption scheme switch on one hand was necessary, since the API will
cease PKCS#7 support in April 2016, while currently supporting both schemes
(actually since April 2015, when they opened the door for RSAES-OAEP).
Besides that I wanted to make the switch early, since I consider going with
better encryption is always the better option.

As Forge didn't yet support RSAES-OAEP I spent some time implementing it
back in August.  My [pull request on
Forge](https://github.com/digitalbazaar/forge/pull/289) unfortunately is
still pending, as Dave is working on an upcoming API change.

Nevertheless Geierlein already ships the patch, so RSAES-OAEP/CMS is used
from now on.
