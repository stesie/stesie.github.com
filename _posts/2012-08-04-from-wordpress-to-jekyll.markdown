I once more decided to update and re-focus my blog.  In the past it
was a wild mix of anything that mattered to me and was worth losing
some words on.  The new blog shall focus on coding, generally and
regarding my projects.  Furthermore I want to keep writing in English
language, that way broadening the possible audience, on the other hand
sharpening my skills in English writing.

Since I love Git and Github, enjoy working on the console and writing
in vim, I was just sick of typing into the Wordpress backend.  After
getting in touch with [Jekyll](https://github.com/mojombo/jekyll/)
when creating a little homepage for Geierlein (and feeling very very
pleased) I decided to migrate the blog to Jekyll as well.

Besides I can host the page on Github that way.
