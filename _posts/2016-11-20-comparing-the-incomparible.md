Lucky me, living in the metropolitan area of Nuremberg, ... this year I was
attending three different developer-oriented open spaces hosted within one hour
driving range from home.

* [devops camp](http://www.devops-camp.de/) in Nuremberg, six iterations so far, first one back in March 2014

And starting this year there are now two developer-centric events (both more or
less claiming to be the first one):

* [developercamp](https://developercamp.io/) in Würzburg, back in September 2016
* [swecamp](https://swe-camp.de/) in Tennenlohe/Erlangen, right yesterday & today

At the closing event of *swecamp* one participant mentioned that he was from Würzburg
and also attended the *developercamp*... and that *swecamp* was really cool yet not
on par with *developercamp*.
Unfortunately he wasn't willing to elaborate on what caused his feeling,
but it kindof struck me ... I couldn't really answer the question which 
of those two camps was better (and remained quiet during the retrospective)...

But it kept bothering me and I had some time thinking on may way home, ... however I
still cannot tell which one was "better", mainly since it doesn't feel right to
compare the incomparible. After all both events attracted (slightly) different
kinds of people. And as barcamps are largely shaped by their participators it's
due to this fact that both events felt different...

*developercamp* was organized by [Mayflower](https://mayflower.de/) which is a
project & consulting agency in PHP & JavaScript field, also doing some Agile
consulting, etc. ... they mainly attracted (and this is personal gut feeling,
not statistics) Webbish people, mostly developers but also a lot of product
owners. Most attendees had an e-commerce background, be it a webshop, some shop software
itself (Benjamin from Shopware was there) or some middleware provider. Topics
were manifold, from *What's the job of a software architect?* (which was
interesting with half the audience from an Agile background and the other half
from a more waterfallish one) over various Product Owner and discovery focussed
stuff to dev-centric like Christopher's *TypeScript Game Engine Primer*. Yet
most sessions felt like fitting into my personal PHP/JavaScript/CleanCode filter
bubble.

Opposed to that *swecamp* was organized by [methodpark](https://www.methodpark.de/)
which also does projects and consulting, yet in more enterprisy contexts:
medical devices and automotive.  They managed to attract people from a
(perceived) broader range of backgrounds ... of course there were many of their
own employees (Java, Embedded), more Java and C#, C++ and embedded devs from
companies nearby ... and of course also some Webbies (like me).  The session topics
were a bit more focussed on the engineering part and theoretical (read: language
agnostic and less hands-on-code oriented) and a bit more testing. There were no
Product Owner things and interestingly no operations stuff (Puppet, Ansible et
al) and IoT was more of a topic (unfortunately I completely missed the IoT hack space)

What was especially cool with *swecamp* was that they had Susume Sasabe from Japan
as a special guest, who did a comparison of DEV culture in Japan and Germany.
He also spoke about Kaizen, different approaches to knowledge transfer, different
problem solving methods etc. ... all in all enriching the whole event every here
and there. Besides that I really enjoyed @NullPlusEins's sessions on (developer)
psychology.

I also happily noticed that CQRS and Event Sourcing were a topic on both events,
maybe a little bit more focussed on DDD at *swecamp*. This isn't too surprising
because of all the microservices buzz (which also was a hot topic on both
events).  Again serverless was not a topic, meh

Last but not least *swecamp* was hosted in methodpark's office which was way
cosier and more comfortable, more decorated than the university building in
Würzburg (where *developercamp* took place).


To sum it up, both events have their unique points. I really enjoyed
*developercamp* (as a Web developer) and also *swecamp*, both had some sessions
that really resonated with me (and after all that's the main reason for me to go
to unconferences: learning about things I don't know that I don't know them).
I'm so happy that I don't have to pick a single event to go to next year.
Both organizers already told that they'll follow up with a second iteration (and
I'm more then willing to go to both of them)




PS: as a funny note, the *devops camp* site is the only one hosted with plain, unencrypted HTTP.
Both more developer focussed events feature SSL :-)

PPS: developercamp also hosts on IPv6 and their hosting also supports Forward Secrecy,
so let's consider it better.  SCNR :-)
