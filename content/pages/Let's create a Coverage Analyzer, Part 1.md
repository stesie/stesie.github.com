Have you ever wondered what happens when you click on "Run with Coverage" in IntelliJ? Obviously it's running the tests, but how is it collecting the coverage information?

Let's create a simple *Line* Coverage Analyzer in and for Java ü•≥

First of all, let's write a simple example program (see [GitHub](https://github.com/stesie/undercovered/blob/main/demo/src/main/java/de/brokenpipe/dojo/undercovered/demo/Demo.java))

```java
package de.brokenpipe.dojo.undercovered.demo;

public class Demo {

	public static void main(final String[] argv) {
		final String greeting = "Hello World";

		bla(greeting);
		bla("to the blarg");

	}

	private static void bla(final String greeting) {
		System.out.println(greeting);
	}
}
```

## Coverage Collection Options

In general coverage data can be collected in multiple ways. We could use profiling/debugging APIs or instrument the code. Instrumentation can be achieved on both, Source Code and Byte Code level. The latter can be done on-the-fly or ahead of time. The on-the-fly part can modify the Application Class Loader or use special APIs available to the Java Agent.

![The flowchart illustrates different approaches to code coverage, branching into "Runtime Profiling" and "Instrumentation," with the latter further dividing into "Source Code" and "Byte Code" instrumentation. The "Byte Code" approach, highlighted in green, is categorized into "ahead of time" and "on-the-fly" modifications, where the latter further splits into "Class Loader" and "Java Agent," also highlighted](/assets/graphviz-instrumentation.png)



## So what is Source Code Instrumentation?

Let's assume we would have a static tracking method like this:

```java
package de.brokenpipe.dojo.undercovered.coverista.tracking;

class Tracker {
    public static void track() {
        // TODO actually track the calling locations here
    }
}
```

... then we would just need to modify our source code like this:

```java
package de.brokenpipe.dojo.undercovered.demo;

import static de.brokenpipe.dojo.undercovered.coverista.tracking.Tracker.track;

public class Demo {

	public static void main(final String[] argv) {
		track(); final String greeting = "Hello World";

		track(); bla(greeting);
		track(); bla("to the blarg");

	}

	private static void bla(final String greeting) {
		track(); System.out.println(greeting);
	}
}
```

... and we should be done. Right!?

Obviously messing with the source code doesn't feel nice. We'd need to re-compile everything, and after all we would need access to the source code in the first place. Also we shouldn't overwrite the original source code, since the user likely doesn't expect us to put all these `track();` calls there.

We also would need to write a parser for Java Code, that understands which lines have a statement, so we can prepend our `track();` call to these. Also considering statements spanning multiple lines.

So given that the Source Code is compiled to Byte Code anyways, how about instrumenting that instead?



## Instrumenting the Byte Code

There are multiple tools, that you can use to inspect the Byte Code that's stored within a .class file. IntelliJ itself has the "Show Bytecode" view action. On the command line there's the `javap` tool, that's part of the JDK. In it's simplest form we can invoke it with the `-c` option, so it disassembles the byte code for us. Running `javap -c demo/target/classes/de/brokenpipe/dojo/undercovered/demo/Demo.class` should print this:

```
  public static void main(java.lang.String[]);
    Code:
       0: ldc           #7                  // String Hello World
       2: astore_1
       3: ldc           #7                  // String Hello World
       5: invokestatic  #9                  // Method bla:(Ljava/lang/String;)V
       8: ldc           #15                 // String to the blarg
      10: invokestatic  #9                  // Method bla:(Ljava/lang/String;)V
      13: return
```

{{< logseq/orgNOTE >}}You might wonder what these hash-numbers are!? These refer to the so-called [constant pool](https://blogs.oracle.com/javamagazine/post/java-class-file-constant-pool).
```console
$ javap -v demo/target/classes/de/brokenpipe/dojo/undercovered/demo/Demo.class 
Constant pool:
   #1 = Methodref          #2.#3          // java/lang/Object."<init>":()V
   #2 = Class              #4             // java/lang/Object
   #3 = NameAndType        #5:#6          // "<init>":()V
   #4 = Utf8               java/lang/Object
   #5 = Utf8               <init>
   #6 = Utf8               ()V
   #7 = String             #8             // Hello World
   #8 = Utf8               Hello World
   #9 = Methodref          #10.#11        // de/brokenpipe/dojo/undercovered/demo/Demo.bla:(Ljava/lang/String;)V
  #10 = Class              #12            // de/brokenpipe/dojo/undercovered/demo/Demo
  #11 = NameAndType        #13:#14        // bla:(Ljava/lang/String;)V
  #12 = Utf8               de/brokenpipe/dojo/undercovered/demo/Demo
  #13 = Utf8               bla
  #14 = Utf8               (Ljava/lang/String;)V
```
So number 7 refers to a `String`, which refers to an `Utf8` blob saying "Hello World". Likewise number 9 refers to a `Methodref` which itself refers to 10, 11 etc., which have the class name, method name and type information.
{{< / logseq/orgNOTE >}}

When adding the `-l` option to the `javap` invocation, it should print the *LineNumberTable* as well:

```
    LineNumberTable:
      line 6: 0
      line 8: 3
      line 9: 8
      line 11: 13
```

Equipped with that knowledge, we can now insert our `track()` method invocations at byte code offsets 0, 3, 8 and 13 ... so we'll end up with something like this:

```
  public static void main(java.lang.String[]);
    Code:
       0: invokestatic  #23                 // Method de/brokenpipe/dojo/undercovered/coverista/Tracker.track:()V
       3: ldc           #7                  // String Hello World
       5: astore_1
       6: invokestatic  #23                 // Method de/brokenpipe/dojo/undercovered/coverista/Tracker.track:()V
       9: ldc           #7                  // String Hello World
      11: invokestatic  #9                  // Method bla:(Ljava/lang/String;)V
      14: invokestatic  #23                 // Method de/brokenpipe/dojo/undercovered/coverista/Tracker.track:()V
      17: ldc           #15                 // String to the blarg
      19: invokestatic  #9                  // Method bla:(Ljava/lang/String;)V
      22: invokestatic  #23                 // Method de/brokenpipe/dojo/undercovered/coverista/Tracker.track:()V
      25: return
    LineNumberTable:
      line 6: 0
      line 8: 6
      line 9: 14
      line 11: 22

```

... and that's it üéâ

But wait! After all, how can we actually hook into the byte code loading in the first place?



## Java Agents

Since Java 5 there's a feature called Java Agents, which are explained in the [java.lang.instrument Package Docs](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/lang/instrument/package-summary.html). There the mechanism is described as follows:
> Provides services that allow Java programming language agents to instrument programs running on the JVM. The mechanism for instrumentation is modification of the byte-codes of methods.

Exactly what we need üòè

In contrast to the `main` method we define in normal application classes, for the agent we need to define a `premain` method, with the following signature:

```java
public static void premain(String agentArgs, Instrumentation inst)
```

... and as the name suggests, it's executed *before* the actual `main` method. There might even be multiple agents, in which cases the `premain` methods are executed in order.

For the agent.jar file to actually work, we need to create a MANIFEST.MF file, declaring a property `Premain-Class` that points to the name of class, holding the `premain` method. Afterward we can pass the `-javaagent:path/to/agent.jar` argument to the `java` command line. The JRE should then already call `premain`.

What we do in this `premain` method is actually up to us. We could mess with the class loader, or we can spin up some threads, monitoring the actual application. We can register shutdown hooks. Or we can just add a transformer, that performs the necessary byte code manipulations.

Our `premain` method receives an instance of the `Instrumentation` class, which has this method:

```java
class Instrumentation {
    /**
     * Registers the supplied transformer.
     * @param transformer          the transformer to register
     */
    void addTransformer(ClassFileTransformer transformer);  
}
```

... and the `ClassFileTransformer` interface is very straight foward:

```java
interface ClassFileTransformer {
    byte[]
    transform(  Module              module,
                ClassLoader         loader,
                String              className,
                Class<?>            classBeingRedefined,
                ProtectionDomain    protectionDomain,
                byte[]              classfileBuffer)
        throws IllegalClassFormatException
}
```

... we get a `byte[]` with the class file contents read from disk, and may return a modified `byte[]`.

So we now know how to register a transformer, that can manipulate the byte code for us. Next step will be to actually come up with an implementation of that thing, that programmatically modifies the byte code array for us.
