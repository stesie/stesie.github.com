While his approach to using a LLM to collect and refine requirements was interesting, ‚Ä¶ what really caught my attention was him mentioning, that he uses Aider to let LLMs modify his code.\nSo what is Aider? Simply put, Aider is a CLI tool that isn‚Äôt tied to a specific LLM. It takes a prompt, sends it to a language model, requests code in a diff-based format, and applies those changes automatically to your project. Additionally, it commits the changes to a Git repository, complete with generated commit messages. Put differently: it saves you from copy \u0026 pasting the LLM suggestions, but takes them over automatically.\nAider also gathers relevant information about the local project (package structure, existing classes etc.) and implicitly provides that context to the LLM, preventing it from acting in a vacuum.\nSo, Aider piqued my curiosity. Vibe Coding is all the rage, and I had been thinking about learning some Kotlin.\nThen came the news that Komoot was acquired by Bending Spoons, which didn‚Äôt seem promising. This reminded me of an old side project I had tinkered with back in October 2022 ‚Äî a Fediverse-enabled route/trip-sharing application. I had spent a few nights on it before getting sidetracked.\nFurthermore my friend Simon asked if I‚Äôd be up for a hackathon-style project. I said yes, though I had no idea what we could work on.\nEnter WueRide Why not combine all these interests into one project?\nOn Monday morning, I texted Simon:\nSomehow¬†I¬†also¬†want/need¬†to¬†resist¬†the¬†urge¬†to¬†start¬†a¬†new¬†software¬†project¬†üòÖ\nYet, the temptation was too strong to resist. Hardly one hour later, I fired up IntelliJ, created a new Kotlin project, and started Aider the first time. My plan was clear: let Aider handle the implementation while I focused on architecture and requirements. Given that I had barely any Kotlin experience‚Äîjust a quick read of the docs the night before‚Äîthis approach was both necessary and exciting.\nFast-forward three days, and I published this toot on wue.social:\nMay I introduce: WueRide\n‚Ä¶ a #fediverse version of the social aspect of #komoot, i.e. a federated adventure log. With support for trips, multi trips (read: collections), images, stars \u0026 commenting.\nCurrently rather a proof of concept, I hacked together over the last three days. Nothing fancy. (yet)\nSee my profile for a first impression: https://wueride.bike/@stesie@wueride.bike\nSource code released under AGPLv3 here: https://codeberg.org/stesie/wueride\nAnd just like that, an early version of WueRide became a reality. Users can create accounts, log in, upload GPX files to create trips, add images (automatically matched to GPX data), follow others, star trips, and leave comments‚Äînot just within WueRide but also from Mastodon or any other Fediverse client.\nAll this for about $8 in LLM usage fees (using Anthropic‚Äôs Claude Sonnet 3.7), which was less than what I spent on the domain name!\nCould I Have Done This Without an LLM? Certainly‚Äîbut not in this timeframe. The federation aspect and high-level goals were mostly clear to me, but the rapid implementation speed wouldn‚Äôt have been possible.\nSo, was this experiment a success? I‚Äôd say yes. I now have a working prototype that I can iterate on.\nWas This ‚ÄúVibe Coding‚Äù? Some might say yes, but based on Andrej Karpathy‚Äôs definition, I‚Äôd say no. Simon Willison surely would also reject.\nWhy not? Because we‚Äôre not there yet. Aider is an excellent tool, and Claude performed well, but I couldn‚Äôt completely ignore the code.\nLooking at git blame, here‚Äôs how the contributions played out:\nTotal Kotlin lines: 4767\nExcluding blanks/imports: 3513\nLines last touched by Claude: 3056 (87%)\nLines last touched by me: 13%\nBut could I forget about the source code? Definitely not. Claude focused on feature implementation, while I debugged and refined the results.\nAnalyzing commit types:\nAider‚Äôs commits:\nfeat: 61 (64.9%)\nrefactor: 26\nfix: 6\nstyle: 1\nMy commits:\nfix: 51\nchore: 18\nrefactor: 12\nfeat: 8\nSo I hardly implemented any feature myself (especially not a larger chunk of work), but had to do a lot of little fix here, small refactor there and from time to time some ‚Äúoh, no I actually meant it that way‚Äù work.\nWhere Did It Struggle? I think generally it did better churning out new code, compared to changing existing code (it wrote earlier). Some struggles it had:\nKotlin‚Äôs Null Safety: The model struggled with strict null checks, since trained mostly on JavaScript and Python (and these don‚Äôt exist there) (example 1, example 2).\nHibernate Polymorphism: Aider didn‚Äôt always handle Hibernate proxies correctly (example).\nBackward-Incompatible Library Changes: For example, the Jenetics JPX (GPX) parser had breaking changes ‚Äúrecently‚Äù, so many (?) of the code examples, Claude was trained on, no longer apply\nRefactoring Challenges: Sometimes existing variable names were re-used (not in the diff itself, but if it adds more code to an existing method), and Claude occasionally failed to recognize inheritance structures (example).\nJuniors struggle with that kind of stuff as well. And I‚Äôm pretty sure Claude (and other LLMs) will even get better soon üôÇ\nConclusion Use of Aider was definitely a huge boost in my productivity. The ‚Äúpaired‚Äù approach of dividing implementation work and debugging turned out to be effective. And I feel like I‚Äôve seen (at least) most of the code, and have a fair understanding of its weaknesses.\n‚Ä¶ that said, I‚Äôd definitely use Aider again and can warmly recommend (at least) trying it.\nHowever I traded (short term) productivity for (long term) deeper understanding of Kotlin. Which is a pity, given that I wanted to actually learn it in the first place üòÇ\nAnd I wouldn‚Äôt agree that you can just ‚ÄúVibe Code‚Äù away and forget about the code. Or you shouldn‚Äôt at least impose Kotlin-use when doing so.\nWhat‚Äôs Next? Honestly, I don‚Äôt know yet.\nI‚Äôd love to build a local, community-driven trip-sharing platform. Perhaps some of you are interested in a hackathon around it?\nBut a social network without users doesn‚Äôt make sense. So, the big question is: Would you be interested in joining or contributing to such a platform?\nComment here.\n","wordCount":"1033","inLanguage":"en","datePublished":"2025-03-30T00:00:00Z","dateModified":"2025-03-30T00:00:00Z","mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://stefansiegl.de/2025/03/building-wueride-experimenting-with-llm-powered-coding-and-the-fediverse/"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"~stesie's musings","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://stefansiegl.de/favicon.ico"}}}</script></head><body id=top><script>localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="dark"?document.body.classList.add("dark"):localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="light"?document.body.classList.remove("dark"):window.matchMedia("(prefers-color-scheme: dark)").matches&&document.body.classList.add("dark")</script><header class=header><nav class=nav><div class=logo><a href=https://stefansiegl.de/ accesskey=h title="~stesie's musings (Alt + H)">~stesie's musings</a><div class=logo-switches><button id=theme-toggle accesskey=t title="(Alt + T)"><svg id="moon" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M21 12.79A9 9 0 1111.21 3 7 7 0 0021 12.79z"/></svg><svg id="sun" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><circle cx="12" cy="12" r="5"/><line x1="12" y1="1" x2="12" y2="3"/><line x1="12" y1="21" x2="12" y2="23"/><line x1="4.22" y1="4.22" x2="5.64" y2="5.64"/><line x1="18.36" y1="18.36" x2="19.78" y2="19.78"/><line x1="1" y1="12" x2="3" y2="12"/><line x1="21" y1="12" x2="23" y2="12"/><line x1="4.22" y1="19.78" x2="5.64" y2="18.36"/><line x1="18.36" y1="5.64" x2="19.78" y2="4.22"/></svg></button></div></div><ul id=menu><li><a href=https://stefansiegl.de/categories/ title=Categories><span>Categories</span></a></li><li><a href=https://stefansiegl.de/archives/ title=Archive><span>Archive</span></a></li><li><a href=https://stefansiegl.de/tags/ title=Tags><span>Tags</span></a></li><li><a href=https://stefansiegl.de/search/ title="Search (Alt + /)" accesskey=/><span>Search</span></a></li></ul></nav></header><main class=main><article class=post-single><header class=post-header><h1 class="post-title entry-hint-parent">Building WueRide - Experimenting with LLM-Powered Coding and the Fediverse</h1><div class=post-meta>Status: üåø Budding&nbsp;¬∑&nbsp;Planted:&nbsp;<span title='2025-03-30 00:00:00 +0000 UTC'>Mar 30, 2025</span>&nbsp;¬∑&nbsp;5 min</div></header><div class=post-content><p>A few weeks ago, I came across Harper Reed‚Äôs blog post, <a href=https://harper.blog/2025/02/16/my-llm-codegen-workflow-atm/>My LLM codegen workflow atm</a>, which made the rounds in the developer community.
