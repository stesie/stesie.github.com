They managed to attract people from a (perceived) broader range of backgrounds … of course there were many of their own employees (Java, Embedded), more Java and C#, C++ and embedded devs from companies nearby … and of course also some Webbies (like me). The session topics were a bit more focussed on the engineering part and theoretical (read: language agnostic and less hands-on-code oriented) and a bit more testing.

He also spoke about Kaizen, different approaches to knowledge transfer, different problem solving methods etc. … all in all enriching the whole event every here and there. Besides that I really enjoyed @NullPlusEins’s sessions on (developer) psychology.\nI also happily noticed that CQRS and Event Sourcing were a topic on both events, maybe a little bit more focussed on DDD at swecamp. This isn’t too surprising because of all the microservices buzz (which also was a hot topic on both events). Again serverless was not a topic, meh.\nLast but not least swecamp was hosted in methodpark’s office which was way cosier and more comfortable, more decorated than the university building in Würzburg (where developercamp took place).\nTo sum it up, both events have their unique points. I really enjoyed developercamp (as a Web developer) and also swecamp, both had some sessions that really resonated with me (and after all that’s the main reason for me to go to unconferences: learning about things I don’t know that I don’t know them). I’m so happy that I don’t have to pick a single event to go to next year. Both organizers already told that they’ll follow up with a second iteration (and I’m more then willing to go to both of them)\nPS: as a funny note, the devops camp site is the only one hosted with plain, unencrypted HTTP.
