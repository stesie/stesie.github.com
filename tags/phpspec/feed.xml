phpspec has some class and method templating built into it. If for example a test fails due to a missing function, it asks whether it should create one (that does nothing at all). This is nice but IMHO breaks the workflow a bit as you have to move the cursor to the terminal window and answer the question.</description></item><item><title>phpspec screencast</title><link>https://stesie.github.io/2016/03/hello-phpspec/</link><pubDate>Wed, 23 Mar 2016 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://stesie.github.io/2016/03/hello-phpspec/</guid><description>After @sD_Tobi recently poked me whether I knew phpspec, … and initially I had no idea except for having heard of it … I found this excellent screencast on laracasts.com to get a first impression. It&amp;rsquo;s just 17 minutes and he&amp;rsquo;s really enthusiastic about it :-)</description></item></channel></rss>
