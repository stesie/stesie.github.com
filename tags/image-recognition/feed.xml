Like in the first round, I will first show the full dialog I&amp;rsquo;ve used to let it generate the implementation. Then following up with a discussion of the code and some final thoughts.
If you&amp;rsquo;ve missed the first part, and to get started on what this is all about, read this article first: Claude writing a Telegram Bot, 1st try :-)</description></item><item><title>Claude writing a Telegram Bot, 1st try</title><link>https://stefansiegl.de/2025/01/claude-writing-a-telegram-bot-1st-try/</link><pubDate>Mon, 27 Jan 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://stefansiegl.de/2025/01/claude-writing-a-telegram-bot-1st-try/</guid><description>This post is the first part, in a mini series (I&amp;rsquo;m aiming for three posts in a row), where I try prompting Claude with different levels of verbosity and compare the results. Below you&amp;rsquo;ll find results of my initial try in using Claude to write a Telegram Bot.
My ultimate goal is to figure out how much gas I need to heat my apartment. The gas meter is located in the hallway outside my apartment and doesn&amp;rsquo;t have a digital interface to tap into.</description></item></channel></rss>
